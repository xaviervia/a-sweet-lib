      </h2>

      <p>Note: the functions in this section depend on other <em>A Sweet Lib</em> functions, which makes them derivative. They are not bundled in the library because they are either extremely easy to derivate or considered corner cases and there is no point in bloating the lib with them. They might be bundled in another lib later on if considered necessary, something like <em>A Sweet Lib <strong>Extended</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>Remember that the purpose of <em>A Sweet Lib</em> if not only convenience: it's first and foremost instructional. These derivations are here to help you understand how the building blocks can be used in very powerful ways, while still keeping the implementation of the derivations terse and expressive.</p>

    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <em>A Sweet Lib</em> gives you the building blocks for a functional programming approach in JavaScript.
    <ul>
      <li>Only higher order functions</li>
      <li>All functions with several arguments are partially applied</li>
      <li>Only essential functions, the building blocks. More domain specific ones you can derive yourself</li>
      <li>Easy to participate. All the functions are gists put as submodules in the lib repo, which means that you can comment on each function individually but also play around with alternative implementation in your own gists and submit them in the repo issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why building this?</h3>
    <p>There is still space in the ecosystem for a library that takes the middle way between the hard core ones that offer to completely change your programming style with a hard core functional approach (such as Ramda) and the ones that just provide solutions to common problems without actually offering any philosophy accompanying them (such as Lodash).</p>
    <p><em>A Sweet Lib</em> aims to hit the sweet spot in the middle: offer a collection of well structured functions based on an idea, but also demystifying them. There is nothing odd about <code>map</code> or <code>reduce</code> and that should be obvious. Your library should tell you that. That's what <em>A Sweet Lib</em> does. Furthermore, <em>A Sweet Lib</em> doesn't need to sit as a global, hard to get rid of dependency in your projects: you can just copy paste the snippets. That's the main purpose of why it was built.</p>

    <p>Not only the code is copy pasteable: the example tests are copy pasteable because they are generic as well. Since they are just functions using assert, they work in all the test libraries I am aware of. Only the path to the original function needs to be rewritten</p>

    <h3>Why are some functions only given as examples and not exposed?</h3>
    <p>It so happens that the functions in the examples are combination of building blocks functions. For example, a very common variation is to fix the arity of the target function while doing a compose, a flip, curry, etc. Many of these combinations lead to, well, combinatorics, which means that a comprehensive list of the derived functions will approximate factorial of the amount of building block functions. To support that is of course nonesense.</p>
    <p>The given examples are carefully chosen to demonstrate common combinations, to provide semantic solutions to common problems (such as the all functions, which is just reduce(and)) and to excite your immagination about the posibilities.</p>
    <p>If you think there is an example that matches the described criteria and it's missing from the lib, please write a gist and comment an issue with it.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Not an utilities library</dt>
      <dd>That's why all functions are higher order functions. They are meant to help you build the logic of your program, not to build it for you.</dd>
